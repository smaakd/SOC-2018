This project was developed during the [Summer of Code 2018, IIT Kanpur](https://soc.cse.iitk.ac.in/). 
The project was based on making a Django based WebApp for seamless detection of attendance via Face Detection. [Azure Face Api](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/cognitive-services/face/) was used to detect faces captured by the camera (CCTV). 
From the image obtained the faces were classified and matched with the pre-existing faces stored in the database to calculate their attendance. This attendance was recorded in short time intervals continuously so as to ensure the continuous presence of that person.
